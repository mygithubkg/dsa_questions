/* You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. ðŸ’§

Test case 1 ---
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

Output: 49

Explanation: The vertical lines at index 1 (height 8) and index 8 (height 7) form the container with the maximum area. The width is 8 - 1 = 7, and the height is limited by the shorter line, which is 7. Area = 7 * 7 = 49.

Test case 2 ---
Input: height = [1,1]

Output: 1 */
