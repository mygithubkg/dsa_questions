## 🛠️ How to Use

1. <b>Browse Topics:</b> Navigate to the folder for your topic of interest.
2. <b>Read & Run Code:</b> Each `.cpp` file is self-contained and well-commented. Some folders have multiple approaches.
3. <b>Compile & Execute:</b> Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ -o solution filename.cpp
   ./solution
   ```
4. <b>Modify Inputs:</b> Most files have a `main()` function for easy input changes and testing.
